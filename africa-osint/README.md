# Welcome to Africa OSINT

![alt text](img/download.jpg)

In the room, we investigate the practice of various OSINT techniques that have been used in Africa. This is important for Image intelligence, geospatial intelligence, social networks, search engines, Language translation, and other OSINT. This room is appropriate for those of you who have just learned about your different OSINT journey. 

## What is OSINT?

**OSINT** is an open-source intelligence that involves collecting of and analyzing of information/data available to the public. These can include social media, newspapers, and even online tools. 

**This room will present to you how to start using OSINT.**

+ By learning the great resources and different challenges (OSINT) [[1]](https://tryhackme.com/room/searchlightosint) [[2]](https://tryhackme.com/room/sakura) [[3]](https://tryhackme.com/room/ohsint) rooms from TryHackMe and other online platforms.
+ To develop a growth mindset and improve logical thinking skills.
+ Concentrating on the [OSINT framework](https://osintframework.com/) using free tools to gather information.
+ Using OSINT tools to facilitate localization, translation, and other tools based on an image, video, and text before answering questions.

The flag format is: **A-THM{flag}** this means that each answer should be submitted in square brackets (Note: no need to submit an answer without "A") 

If you are stuck inside this room, ask for help in the TryHackMe discord. You may also  find me on Twitter and I can give you additional  information :)
